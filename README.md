# CP Relay Web Arena Experience
 This repo is to enhance the competitor experience of the web arena. This would initially include solving reported bugs,  making the experience more consistent,  additions to the UI, like a browser plugin that adds the boilerplate code etc, working on the editor experience and later enhancing the arena with new features.
